However, the significance of this invention \u2013 the stepwell \u2013 goes beyond its utilitarian application."

During their heyday, they were places of gathering, of leisure, of relaxation and of worship for villagers of all but the lowest castes.Most stepwells are found dotted around the desert areas of Gujarat (where they are called vav) and Rajasthan (where they are known as baori), while a few also survive in Delhi. Some were located in or near villages as public spaces for the community; others were positioned beside roads as resting places for travellers."

Others are more elaborate, with long stepped passages leading to the water via several storeys built from stone and supported by pillars, they also included pavilions that sheltered visitors from the relentless heat. But perhaps the most impressive features are the intricate decorative sculptures that embellish many stepwells, showing activities from fighting and dancing to everyday acts such as women combing their hair and churning butter."

But the Archaeological Survey of India began restoring it in the 1960s, and today it\u2019s in pristine condition. At 65 metres long, 20 metres wide and 27 metres deep, Rani Ki Vav features 500 distinct sculptures carved into niches throughout the monument, depicting gods such as Vishnu and Parvati in various incarnations. Incredibly, in January 2001, this ancient structure survived a devastating earthquake that measured 7.6 on the Richter scale."

It\u2019s actually a tank (kund means reservoir or pond) rather than a well, but displays the hallmarks of stepwell architecture, including four sides of steps that descend to the bottom in a stunning geometrical formation.

Although modern information technologies can reduce the demand for physical transport by facilitating teleworking and teleservices, the requirement for transport continues to increase. There are two key factors behind this trend. For passenger transport, the determining factor is the spectacular growth in car use. The number of cars on European Union (EU) roads saw an increase of three million cars each year from 1990 to 2010, and in the next decade the EU will see a further substantial increase in its fleet."

In the last 20 years, as internal frontiers have been abolished, the EU has moved from a \u201dstock\u201d economy to a \u201dflow\u201d economy. This phenomenon has been emphasised by the relocation of some industries, particularly those which are labour intensive, to reduce production costs, even though the production site is hundreds or even thousands of kilometres away from the final assembly plant or away from users."

In 1998, some of these countries already exported more than twice their 1990 volumes and imported more than five times their 1990 volumes. And although many candidate countries inherited a transport system which encourages rail, the distribution between modes has tipped sharply in favour of road transport since the 1990s. Between 1990 and 1998，road haulage increased by 19.4%, while during the same period rail haulage decreased by 43.5%, although \u2013 and this could benefit the enlarged EU \u2013 it is still on average at a much higher level than in existing member states."

This objective, agreed by the Gothenburg European Council, has to be achieved by integrating environmental considerations into Community policies, and shifting the balance between modes of transport lies at the heart of its strategy. The ambitious objective can only be fully achieved by 2020, but proposed measures are nonetheless a first essential step towards a sustainable transport system which will ideally be in place in 30 years\u201f time, that is by 2040."

According to the latest estimates, if nothing is done to reverse the traffic growth trend, CO2 emissions from transport can be expected to increase by around 50% to 1,113 billion tonnes by 2020，compared with the 739 billion tonnes recorded in 1990. Once again, road transport is the main culprit since it alone accounts for 84% of the CO2 emissions attributable to transport. Using alternative fuels and improving energy efficiency is thus both an ecological necessity and a technological challenge."

In the short term it might curb the growth in road transport through the better loading ratio of goods vehicles and occupancy rates of passenger vehicles expected as a result of the increase in the price of transport. However, the lack of measures available to revitalise other modes of transport would make it impossible for more sustainable modes of transport to take up the baton."

However, this approach does not include investment in new infrastructure, nor does it guarantee better regional cohesion. It could help to achieve greater uncoupling than the first approach, but road transport would keep the lion\u201fs share of the market and continue to concentrate on saturated arteries, despite being the most polluting of the modes. It is therefore not enough to guarantee the necessary shift of the balance."

This integrated approach would allow the market shares of the other modes to return to their 1998 levels and thus make a shift of balance. It is far more ambitious than it looks, bearing in mind the historical imbalance in favour of roads for the last fifty years, but would achieve a marked break in the link between road transport growth and economic growth, without placing restrictions on the mobility of people and goods."

There are, nevertheless, people working in luxurious, state-of-the-art centres designed to stimulate innovation who find that their environment doesn\u2019t make them feel at all creative. And there are those who don\u2019t have a budget, or much space, but who innovate successfully."

            "content": "For Robert B. Cialdini, Professor of Psychology at Arizona State University, one reason that companies don\u2019t succeed as often as they should is that innovation starts with recruitment. Research shows that the fit between an employee\u2019s values and a company\u2019s values makes a difference to what contribution they make and whether, two years after they join, they\u2019re still at the company. Studies at Harvard Business School show that, although some individuals may be more creative than others, almost every individual can be creative in the right circumstances."

The 1956 picture of singers Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash and Jerry Lee Lewis jamming at a piano in Sun Studios in Memphis tells a hidden story. Sun\u2019s \u2018million-dollar quartet\u2019 could have been a quintet. Missing from the picture is Roy Orbison\u2019 a greater natural singer than Lewis, Perkins or Cash. Sam Phillips, who owned Sun, wanted to revolutionise popular music with songs that fused black and white music, and country and blues. Presley, Cash, Perkins and Lewis instinctively understood Phillips\u2019s ambition and believed in it. Orbison wasn\u2019t inspired by the goal, and only ever achieved one hit with the Sun label."

            "content": "The value fit matters, says Cialdini, because innovation is, in part, a process of change, and under that pressure we, as a species, behave differently, \u2018When things change, we are hard-wired to play it safe.\u2019 Managers should therefore adopt an approach that appears counterintuitive -they should explain what stands to be lost if the company fails to seize a particular opportunity. Studies show that we invariably take more gambles when threatened with a loss than when offered a reward."

            "content": "Managing innovation is a delicate art. It\u2019s easy for a company to be pulled in conflicting directions as the marketing, product development, and finance departments each get different feedback from different sets of people. And without a system which ensures collaborative exchanges within the company, it\u2019s also easy for small \u2018pockets of innovation\u201f to disappear. Innovation is a contact sport. You can\u201ft brief people just by saying, \u2018We\u2019re going in this direction and I\u2019m going to take you with me.\u2019"

Watson, together with Francis Crick, discovered the structure of DNA, the genetic information carrier of all living organisms. \u2018When asked how they had cracked the code ahead of an array of highly accomplished rival investigators, he said something that stunned me. He said \u201dhe and Crick had succeeded because they were aware that they weren\u2019t the most intelligent of the scientists pursuing the answer. The smartest scientist was called Rosalind Franklin who, Watson said, \u201cwas so intelligent she rarely sought advice\u201d.\u2019"

Research shows that peer power, used horizontally not vertically, is much more powerful than any boss\u2019s speech."

Cialdini cites scores of research papers and historical events that prove that even something as simple as writing deepens every individual\u2019s engagement in the project. It is, he says, the reason why all those competitions on breakfast cereal packets encouraged us to write in saying, in no more than 10 words: \u2018I like Kellogg\u2019s Com Flakes because\u2026 .\u2019 The very act of writing makes us more likely to believe it."

The wrong kind of leadership will lead to what Cialdini calls \u201dcaptainitis, the regrettable tendency of team members to opt out of team responsibilities that are properly their\u2019. He calls it captainitis because, he says, \u201dcrew members of multipilot aircraft exhibit a sometimes deadly passivity when the flight captain makes a clearly wrong-headed decision\u201d. This behaviour is not, he says, unique to air travel, but can happen in any workplace where the leader is overbearing."

This environment encouraged a free interchange of ideas, which led to more creativity with form, function, colour and materials that revolutionised attitudes to furniture design."

Cialdini says:\u201dLeaders should encourage everyone to contribute and simultaneously assure all concerned that every recommendation is important to making the right decision and will be given full attention\u201d The frustrating thing about innovation is that there are many approaches, but no magic formula. However, a manager who wants to create a truly innovative culture can make their job a lot easier by recognising these psychological realities."
